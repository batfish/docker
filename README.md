# Batfish Docker Images

This repo contains the source files necessary to build [Batfish](https://github.com/batfish/batfish) and
`allinone` (Batfish plus [Pybatfish](https://github.com/batfish/pybatfish) and Jupyter) docker images.

Using one of the pre-built containers from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/batfish/)
is the quickest and easiest way to get started using Batfish.

## Running containers

* For a getting started experience, follow the [allinone guide](allinone.md).
* For running the Batfish service *only*, follow the [Batfish service guide](batfish.md).

## Building and pushing images

If you are a developer of Batfish, see [dev instructions](README.dev.md) on how to build images and push them to Docker Hub.
